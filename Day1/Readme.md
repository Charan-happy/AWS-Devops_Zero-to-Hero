Introduction to AWS

Let's learn how to create AWS account and fundamentals of cloud computing 

[Types of cloud computing](#types-of-cloud-computing)

what is cloud computing ?
- providing compute resources over internet is called cloud computing.

**Benefits of AWS**
- pay-per use payment model
- Instant scalability/go-global in minutes
- Reliable/redundant
- Highly secured
  

### Types of cloud computing

- Cloud computing types are divided into two types, they are 1. Service models 2. Deployment models
  
  Before going to know about them, let's know about virtualization first
<details>
<summary>Why do organizations and businesses use virtualization for cloud computing? </summary><br><b>

using virtualization increases the efficient use of hardware, which in turn lowers the cost of building, sustaining, and hosting computers in data centers as a cloud service. Virtualization products are therefore extremely important to businesses operating private or public clouds.

# Types of cloud computing {Based on service}
1. SAAS
2. PAAS
3. IAAS
   
**SAAS**:
- It is the simplest to use and the easiest to deploy
- With SAAS, Users have direct, on-demand access to shared applications and data over the internet.
- There is no software to install or configure - everything is available via web browser.
- EX: Microsoft office 365 and slack

**PAAS**:
- For users, who need more control and flexibility , PAAS is the solution
- With this service model, web developers and programmers can upload their content to pre-configured web servers, database servers, and application servers without having to install or maintain any of the servers’ applications or operating systems
- EX: Amazon S3, Amazon Route 53, AWS and GCP 
- with PAAS, we will get ready-to-go services that don't require the need to build or install anything from scratch.
- PAAS provides extra ability to build on top of the services by, for ex: Using API to integrate with another service and life-cycle management.

**IAAS**:
- For maximum control, IAAS can be used
- It gives access to a dedicated virtual or physical system that you manage and maintain yourself.
- IAAS Provides the greatest degree of flexibility and customization of the three cloud computing types.
- EX : Digital ocean

# Types of cloud computing (Based on deployment Models)
- The world "deployment" used in computing circles, is usually refers to all the activities involved in making software or hardware available and ready for use : installation, configuration (setting up), testing, making changes, and then running
- Organizations choose among the different models based on their business goals, computing, networking and storage requirements and budget.

Basically there are 4 deployment models in cloud, they are

1. Private cloud
2. Public Cloud
3. Hybrid Cloud
4. Community cloud

![Cloud_deployment model](/images/Cloud%20Deployment%20Model.png)

**Private clouds** are computing resources managed by a specific organization for internal business goals or objectives that typically reside on a company’s intranet or hosted data center. (It’s important to note here that a cloud doesn’t necessarily have to be on the internet.) 

**Public cloud** are usually managed by a third-party business or organization to offer computing resources to customers

**Community/hybrid cloud**

**Global Infrastructure**
    **Regions**

    **Availability zones**

    **Edge Locations**
