AWS Cloudwatch

Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring service for cloud resources and applications. It provides data and actionable insights for developers, system operators, and business users to monitor applications, respond to system performance changes, optimize resource utilization, and gain insights into application and infrastructure performance.

CloudWatch collects monitoring data from AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, RDS databases, and S3 buckets. It also collects custom metrics from your applications and services. You can use CloudWatch to create alarms to notify you when specific metrics exceed or fall below specified thresholds.

CloudWatch provides a variety of visualizations to help you understand your monitoring data. You can create custom dashboards to display the metrics that are most important to you. CloudWatch also integrates with other AWS services, such as Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing, to provide a comprehensive view of your application and infrastructure performance.
