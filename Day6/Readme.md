AWS Route 53

Amazon Route 53 is a scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS) web service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is designed to route end users to internet applications by translating human-readable domain names into the numeric IP addresses that computers use to connect to each other. Route 53 can be used to route traffic to various AWS services, such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and load balancers, as well as to non-AWS infrastructure.

Route 53 offers various features, including DNS failover, health checks, latency-based routing, and geo-proximity routing. It is commonly used by businesses and organizations to ensure reliable and efficient routing of internet traffic to their applications and services
